Crystal Collector Game
# Overview
This is an interactive game for web browsers. This game was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.

The object of the game is to match the players number to the random number that is displayed to the user.

HOW TO PLAY:
There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, the player's score counter will be updated.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
